# APIs and API terminology

This AEP describes the terms used to describe various parts of an API
specification in depth.

## Guidance

### API Name

An API name is a string that **must** uniquely identify the API. It serves as a
namespace where elements of an API are defined, including:

- [resource types][/resource-types]
- [methods][/standard-methods]

In practice, it is difficult to prevent the re-use of the name across different
APIs. Therefore the API should use something, such as the domain name of the
primary server hosting the API and a possible path prefix, as the name.

If a primary server does not exist (for example, a public cloud where every
domain always includes a regional subdomain), then a similar placeholder that
can still ensure uniqueness can be used. For example APIs served at
`{region}.cloud-storage.public-cloud.com` may use
`cloud-storage.public-cloud.com`.

The API Name:

- **must** only uses valid domain name characters as specified in
  [RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-2.3.1), or a
  backslash `[.-a-z0-9/]`)
- **must** use all lower case.
- **should not** use path prefixes that could also be misconstrued as a
  resource collection (e.g. `apis.examples.com/users`)

### API Name Examples

- `networking.istio.io`
- `pubsub.example.com`
- `spanner.example.com/v1`
- `apis.example.com/user` (valid, but discouraged to possible confusion with a
  collection name.).

## API Services

An API service is distinct from an API name: A name is a common string that is
used to define an API agnostic of the address by which it is served, while an
API service is a live service which exposes an API.

In many cases, the address of an API service and an API name may be identical
(for example, an api `api.example.com` may expose that same API at
`api.example.com`).

An API name **must not** be assumed to be an address of an API. Instead, use a
location where that metadata is stored. For example, OpenAPI provides a
[server object](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.1.html#server-object) for
this purpose.
