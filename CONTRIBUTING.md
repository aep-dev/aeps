## Editing AEP Rules

If you spot a minor issue that seems to be a mistake, such as a typo, please make an PR with a fix.

For any substantive change or new rule proposal, it is best to search the [discussions](https://github.com/aep-dev/aeps/discussions) 
for similar topics before opening a new one. Lighter weight discussions also happen in #aep channel 
in the CNCF Slack is another place or in our weekly Friday calls for quick validation of the concept.

Once there is a clear point of view articulated and some amount of support gathered, the next step 
would be to open a PR to reference the discussion and describe the work to be done. Any subsequent 
pull request should then reference the issue and will enter the queue for review.

## Development Environment

If you are contributing AEP content (rather than code) and want to be able to
view it in your browser, the easiest way to do so is to use our [site-generator project](https://github.com/aep-dev/site-generator).

### Updating examples

The example files are code-generated by [aepc](https://github.com/aep-dev/aepc)
and copied into this repository.

Specifically, the following files are copied over:

| aeps file                                                        | aepc file                                                                                                                            |
