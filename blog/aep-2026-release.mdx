# The Coordination Challenge

Building software is a team sport, but keeping everyone on the same page is
hard. When every team has to invent their own API patterns — deciding how
pagination works, or how to format errors — we end up with a lot of wasted
effort and systems that don't quite fit together. This isn't just about having
"standards". It's about ensuring that users and tools don't have to
continuously relearn the same standards.

# A Shared Standard and Tools

The aep-2026 edition is our answer to that friction. It is an opinionated API
design specification, providing well-defined requirements around common REST
concepts like CRUD standard methods, pagination, filtering, and more. By
agreeing on these common patterns, we make it easier for services to talk to
each other, clients to be built, and for developers to move between projects
without needing to learn idiosyncratic conventions.

AEP (API Enhancement Proposals) is an open-source, "anti-bike shedding" kit. It
answers the routine questions so we can all focus on the interesting ones. It’s
about a shared foundation that lifts everyone up and lets everyone build on the
same tooling platform.

# Stability for Builders

To build lasting tools, you need a solid foundation. You can't build tooling on
top of a spec that changes regularly. The aep-2026 edition is a major milestone
because we are introducing a stable version of the specification and
establishing a release cadence with [AEP-300](https://aep.dev/300/). This
decouples stability for consumers and evolving our best practices:

- **For Builders:** Invest in linters, libraries, and other
  [tools](https://aep.dev/tooling-and-ecosystem/#tools) today knowing they will
  keep working for years.
- **For the Future:** We can keep discussing new improvements for the next
  edition (AEP-2028) without breaking the tools you rely on right now.

The tooling is guaranteed to be compatible for the three most
[recent editions of AEPs](https://aep.dev/300/#first-party-clients-and-tooling),
effectively a **6 year stability cycle** based on our current 2-year cadence.

# The Tooling Ecosystem

Because the standard is now stable, we can share a set of tools that help
everyone do less grunt work. The 2026 edition launches with a compatible
ecosystem ready for you to use:

- **Infrastructure:** A
  [Terraform Provider](https://github.com/aep-dev/terraform-provider-aep) to
  handle the deployment details.
- **Integration:** An [MCP Server](https://github.com/aep-dev/aep-mcp-server)
  to let AI agents understand your APIs out of the box.
- **Exploration:** An [Interactive Web UI](http://ui.aep.dev) to make daily
  development smoother.
- **Speed:** A [CLI](https://github.com/aep-dev/aepcli) to quickly call an
  AEP-compatible service.

# Next Steps

Come see what we’ve built. Whether you use the whole platform or just grab a
few good ideas, you are welcome here.

- **Explore:** Check out the
  [Tools Page](https://aep.dev/tooling-and-ecosystem/#tools) to see what's
  available or visit the [aep.dev](http://aep.dev) site to review the numbered
  rules.
- **Join:** Drop into a
  [weekly Friday meeting](https://github.com/aep-dev/aeps/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#learn-and-connect)
